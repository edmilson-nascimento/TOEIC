# Verbs Patterns #
Remember! When we are usign any ver pattern, it is the MAIN verb which controls the tense and the SVA.

**These verbs can use "to inf" or "ing" but the meaning changes.**

## Exemples ##
I **stooped** _to talk_ to my friend.
(Because I wanted to talk to my friend, I stopped doing something...)

I **stopped** _talking_ to my friend. 
(We aren't friends. I don't talk to her these days) (the ~ing verb doesn't happen now)


I **forgot** _to lock_ the door.
(I did not do something that is important)

I **forgot** _drinking_ the bottle of tequila last night.
(I did something, but it is not im my brain now. Too much alcohol, bad memory, old, busy, stressed, injury)


Please **remember** _to do_ your homework.
(Please do this important thing / advice)

I **remember** _going_ to school for the first time.
(I did something and I can still RECALL it)
