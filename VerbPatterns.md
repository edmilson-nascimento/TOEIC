# Verbs Patterns #
Remember! When we are usign any ver pattern, it is the MAIN verb which controls the tense and the SVA.

**These verbs can use "to inf" or "ing" but the meaning changes.**

(Because I wanted to talk to my friend, I stopped doing something...)

I **stopped** _talking_ to my friend.
